more time spent with Gimp than Visual studio. Icon designing is interesting.
I found interesting ui turorial : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPn6pgBGfy4

seems like Photoshop is better than Gimp. Especially the Bevel and Emboss filter.
In Gimp, one needs to manually define the height of regions to emboss but not in Photoshop.

* +759,	292

[[File:colmesh.jpg]]<br>
Defining coaser detailed collision mesh for asteroid. Now engine can import this information to generate mesh collision shape as well as other types(Box, Sphere and Compound)

[[File:bvhcol.jpg]]<br>
now exact collision detection is possible. ( lines are drawn without depth culling, so looks have many vertices.)

== 2015-01-10 Reporting collision events ==

* Engine
** Integrated serveral physics interfaces into one(ITransformExchanger, IColShapeProvider and ICollisionEventHander)
** Saving user ptr into physics instances.
** Notifying collision events to the application.

* Game
** Adding new components in RunTime.
** Detaching modules when it collided with static rigid bodies.(working on)

* +385, -150

== 2015-01-12 Ship crash ==
* Engine
** Collision filtering

* Game
** Camera Shaking
** An option for effects not to inherit parent's rotation
** Rigid body feedback for engine output effects
** Added 'material' amd 'materialParams' for ModelComponent
** Modular ship destruction

* +842, -160

== 2015-01-13 Fracturing ==

*Engine
** Support fracture meshes.
*** Import fracture meshes
*** Generate fracture rigid bodies.
** Interface for convex collision shapes
** Changed fastbird::RigidBody to be inherited from btRigidBody.

* Game
** Added FractureComp - mapping physical rigid bodies and graphicals
** Runtime removal of components

* +739, -357

[[File:fracture.jpg]]<br>
Now detached modules are fractured and scattered.

== 2015-01-14 Multiple modular ship support ==

* Physics
** Gluing debris - break when certain threshold is exceeded.
** Ray test supported

* Game
** Multiple modular ship support.
** Replace ray test to use Bullet Physics library.

* +516	-174

[[File:multiple_modularship.jpg]]<br>
Now can have multiple modular ships.

== 2015-01-15 Space Station as a modular ship ==

Game
** Debug Draw : ActorId - 'GameDebugFlag 1'
** Fixed Ray Cast bug
** Save/Load individual actors to a file.
** Added Space Station composed with serveral modules
** Fixed loading carrier modules containing eagles
** Added two movement mode - Destination mode and Direction mode
*** It is convinient to use Destination mode when the ship need to arrive at certain position,
And Direction mode is for user controlling ships and avoiding obstacles.
** Modules that are not reachable to the core module will be automatically detached from the modular ship.

* Physics
** Cleaned User Ptr related codes.
** Direction alignmend codes moved to game project

* +731, -250

[[File:docking_01.jpg]]<br>
Approaching to the space station.

[[File:docking_02.jpg]]<br>
Trying to docking. (conceptual) If the ship approaches to the space station with high speed, modules collided will be fractured. Need to be careful.
Since player can control forward/backward speed, rotation and horizontal/vertical parallel speed, I'm expecting docking might be fun.

== 2015-01-17 Space station ui ==

** Added Geometry Renderer
** Overriding environment map for render targets.

* Game
** Improved horizontal/vertical movement of ships with mouse middle btn.

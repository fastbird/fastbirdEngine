'''Improved planet rendering'''

[[File:planet_before.jpg]]<br>
Previous. Although the planet is a sphere, its atmosphere(textured) looks flat.

[[File:planet_after.jpg]]<br>
Improved. Now looks real sphere.

'''New tone mapping operator.'''

[[File:reinhard.jpg]]<br>
Previous. With tweaked Reinhard tone mapping operator. I felt this method is not easy to use in very dark scenes( when the average luminance is too small).

[[File:filmic5.jpg]]<br>
With Filmic Tone mapping operator. This method inspired by film's characteristic.<br>
Reference : http://filmicgames.com/archives/6 <br>
This method doesn't need to calculate scene's luminance but I'm still calculating it for bloom effects and anamorphic lens flares.

Lua is very helpful to build game event system due to its properties like type-free variables and non-pre-declared variable support.
Writing this kind of system in C++ might be difficult.

XMind is a good tool to manage tasks for a tiny team. Redmine or Hansoft etc might be over functional.
XMind is very flexible, easy to modify, easy to list all tasks and mark the estimated time so can keep in mind the overall process and remained task.
The problem is remained tasks do not decrease but increase instead. Tasks like 'Packing game data', 'Intro / Ending / Credit scenes', 'Resolution changes' or 'Create Promotion movies' are recently added.
There should be more missing tasks......

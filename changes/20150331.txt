Physics

	Reporting collision is now done by Step Tick callback - should do this to prevent refering deleted collision objects
	Using continuos collision for fast traveling objects like bullets


UI
	Hiding all uis with exception
	Now one can specify delta value(relative to the previous component) for component position. 
	Added translating feature. Texts start with '@' will be translated.
	Added NamedPortrait component
	Fixed order of processing inputs.
	Removed the Blinking feature. Added the Highlighting feature
	Fixed image display when scrolling
	Tweaked the NamedPortrait component

	/** SpinLocks are efficient if threads are only likely to be blocked for 
	a short period of time, as they avoid overhead from operating
	system process re-scheduling or context switching. However, spinlocks become 
	wasteful if held for longer durations, both preventing other threads from 
	running and requiring re-scheduling. The longer a lock is held by a thread, 
	the greater the risk that it will be interrupted by the O/S scheduler while holding 
	the lock. If this happens, other threads will be left "spinning" (repeatedly trying 
	to acquire the lock), while the thread holding the lock is not making progress 
	towards releasing it. The result is a semi-deadlock until the thread holding 
	the lock can finish and release it. This is especially true on a single-processor 
	system, where each waiting thread of the same priority is likely to waste its 
	quantum (allocated time where a thread can run) spinning until the thread that 
	holds the lock is finally finished.*/
